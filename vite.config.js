// View your website at your own local server
// for example http://vite-php-setup.test

// http://localhost:5133 is serving Vite on development
// but accessing it directly will be empty
// TIP: consider changing the port for each project, see below

// IMPORTANT image urls in CSS works fine
// BUT you need to create a symlink on dev server to map this folder during dev:
// ln -s {path_to_project_source}/src/assets {path_to_public_html}/assets
// on production everything will work just fine
// (this happens because our Vite code is outside the server public access,
// if it were, we could use https://vitejs.dev/config/server-options.html#server-origin)
